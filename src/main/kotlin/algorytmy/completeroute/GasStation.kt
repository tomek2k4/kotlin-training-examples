    Example 1:
    Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
    Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
    Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
    Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
    Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
    Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
    Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

    Example 2:
    Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
    Output: -1
    Explanation:
    You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
    Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
    Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
    Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
    You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
    Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
